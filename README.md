# Customer Segmentation with RFM and Machine Learning

This project performs customer segmentation using **RFM analysis** (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and applies supervised machine learning models to classify customers into segments such as:

- Champions  
- Loyal Customers  
- Recent Customers  
- At Risk  
- Big Spenders  
- Others  

### 🔍 Key Steps:
1. Data preprocessing from the Superstore dataset
2. RFM feature engineering
3. Customer segmentation using custom logic
4. Model training using:
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - XGBoost Classifier
5. Model comparison using classification reports
6. Visualization of customer segments

### ✅ Best Model:
Random Forest showed the best performance with **~96% accuracy**.

### 📊 Tools & Libraries:
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- scikit-learn (sklearn)
- XGBoost
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

### 📁 Dataset:
- Superstore.xls (Used for building the RFM table)
